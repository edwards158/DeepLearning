# Deep Learning

This repository contains my work in the field of Deep Learning.  Some of the notebooks relate to the  [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program, which consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics.  These notebooks are mostly implemented in Tensorflow.

The other material is notebooks of experiments, hacks and code ideas from various sources.  These mostly consist of notebooks implemented in Keras with Tensorflow backend.  For these notebooks I have used the following sources as my guide:

- [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/books.html)
- [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com)
- [Sebastian Ruder](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/)
- [Ritchie Ng](https://www.ritchieng.com/)
- [Kevin Markham](https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool)

I run these notebooks on a Windows machine with GeForce 1060 6Gb.
